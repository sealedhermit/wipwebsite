In a land of gadgets and gizmos so fine,
Greeshma got an Apple Watch, a real design.
Series 8, sleek and shiny, oh what a sight,
A treasure she cherished, day and night.

But alas, a cold came with a sneeze and a cough,
Bedridden she lay, her spirits not off.
Her Apple Watch gleamed, untouched, in repose,
As tissues and remedies battled her woes.

Days turned to nights, and then came a breeze,
She rose from her slumber, her heart at ease.
Her Watch on her wrist, she felt so high,
But her heart raced faster, oh my, oh my!

Heartbeats galore, ECGs in stride,
She checked and she wondered, eyes open wide.
"Why so fast?" she pondered, with a furrowed brow,
The Watch on her wrist, it teased her somehow.

"It's watching me watch it," she joked with a grin,
"The numbers it shows, they're all in a spin!"
"It's the Watch that rides the beat," she'd jest and quip,
Her heart danced along, a merry little skip.

And then, in a twist, her secret was unveiled,
Her husband, the jester, had loudly hailed:
"Behold, Greeshma's Watch, a gem so bright,
Announcing its presence with pure delight!"

Her neighbor chuckled, a knowing glance,
A watchful eye caught in circumstance.
But Greeshma just laughed, her heart still aglow,
Her Watch on her wrist, a friend in the know.

Now, straps she does seek, to adorn her new love,
But the cost gives her pause, like a sign from above.
Yet she smiles at her Watch, her companion so grand,
In this tale of tech, heartbeats, and a sneeze in the land.
