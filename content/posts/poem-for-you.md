On a July day, our destinies did intertwine,
Through letters shared on Slowly's line,

Frustrations poured, my heart laid bare,
Not expecting a reply, yet she was there.

Greeshma, a name that breathed new life,
In conversations, we found no strife,

On Telegram's wings, we soared above,
Texting ceaselessly, a symphony of love.

No boredom found in moments shared,
Your life, my own, both hearts laid bare,

In thoughts, in actions, attitude aligned,
A connection profound, fate defined.

To Chennai's call, I had to depart,
A meeting's grasp pulling at my heart,

Fear not, for love knows no divide,
Through delays, our souls did confide.

As days went by, a bond took flight,
A love so pure, an exquisite sight,

Intimacy bloomed, a sacred dance,
Two souls entwined in this wild romance.

"Gechu," I called you, a name so dear,
In this secret world, love whispered clear,

As husband and wife in dreams we'd play,
Discussing futures in love's array.

Through office hours, hearts found a way,
Texting fervently, with no delay,

A little world, a place to feel whole,
With each passing moment, love's story to unroll.

And then the day, I pledged a rhyme,
To capture your essence, love's purest chime,

In a stranger's arms, a connection found,
Two crazy souls, with love unbound.

So here it is, a poem for the one,
Whose love shines bright, like the morning sun,

In your presence, I find complete,
A love so rare, a love so sweet.
