You are extremely busy with your life, and I feel that whatever I do to make you happy or feel close to me is not working. I wonder why the people to whom we show so much care and attention almost always ignore us and instead seek out those who neglect and avoid them. Could this behavior be related to human psychology? I thought about this the whole night yesterday and came up with the following. 

**Novelty and excitement**: 

Sometimes, people are drawn to others who seem more mysterious or elusive. The excitement of chasing someone who appears less available can be alluring to some individuals. This doesn't necessarily mean you want to neglect or ignore me, but the initial pursuit might have been more exciting for you.

**Fear of commitment**: 

Some individuals may have difficulties with commitment or forming deep emotional connections. You might be afraid of getting too close to someone or fear being vulnerable. So, you  may inadvertently push away those who genuinely care.

**Self-esteem and validation**: 

People's self-esteem can play a significant role in their social interactions. Some may seek validation and attention from those who seem to be less interested or harder to get, as it gives them a sense of being desired or valuable.

**Prioritization of time and energy**: 

Busy individuals may have limited time and energy to invest in their relationships. While they may genuinely care for their friends, they might not be able to reciprocate the attention in the same way due to other life commitments.

**Communication and understanding**: 

Sometimes, miscommunication or misunderstanding can lead to feelings of neglect. It's crucial to have open and honest conversations about your feelings and concerns to ensure both of us understand each other's perspectives.

**Attachment styles**: 

Different individuals have different attachment styles that can influence one's behavior in relationships. Some people may have a more avoidant attachment style, making them less comfortable with emotional intimacy.


All this said, I respect your boundaries and decisions, as people have the right to choose their friends and connections based on their own feelings and preferences.

Have a great day!
