Greeshu,

From the moment I got to know you, it wasn't just your relationship status that captured my heart. It was the way you carried yourself, the kindness and the genuine warmth I felt within you. 
Love doesn't always follow a linear path; it's a complex and unpredictable emotion.

I fell in love with you because of who you are, the unique qualities that make you, well, you. 
I saw the beauty in your heart and soul, the way you made me laugh, the way you cared for those around you, and the way you brightened up my world with your presence.

Yes, I knew you had someone in the beginning, and I respected that. I never intended to interfere with your existing relationship. 
But life has its own way of unfolding, and feelings can be uncontrollable. What I felt for you grew naturally, and it was a force too strong to ignore.

Please understand that it wasn't a choice to fall in love with you; it was something that happened beyond my control. 
Love is a powerful emotion that can't be confined to societal norms or circumstances. What matters most is that I love you for who you are, and I'm here to support you and cherish every moment we have together.

So, my dear, my love for you isn't based on when we met or your relationship status at the time. 
It's based on the incredible person you are, and it's a love that I promise to nurture and cherish, no matter where life takes us.

With all my heart,


Vidhu
