Greeshu,

As I sit down to pen these words, my heart dances with joy, for you have become the most cherished chapter of my life. 
Our journey, initiated through the virtual threads of an online letter, has woven a tapestry of emotions that now binds us in the sweetest bond. 
You, with your effervescent spirit and boundless enthusiasm, have transformed my world into a canvas of vibrant colors and delightful melodies.


From the first words we exchanged, carried by the digital winds of Slowly, to the warmth of our conversations on Telegram and the music of our shared laughter in calls, every moment spent with you has been a treasure etched into the tapestry of my memories. 
Your liveliness has a way of brightening even the dullest of days, and your enthusiasm is a constant source of inspiration that fuels my own passions.

You, Greeshma, are not just a friend but a beacon of light that has illuminated the corners of my heart. 
Your presence has painted my life with laughter, love, and an inexplicable sense of belonging. Through every text, every word spoken, and every shared moment, I find myself falling deeper in admiration for the wonderful person you are.

It is with the sincerest of emotions that I declare, you have become my favorite person, my confidante, and the beat that sets the rhythm of my days. 
As the chapters of our story continue to unfold, I am excited to embrace each page with you by my side, knowing that the narrative of our friendship is one that will forever be etched in the tapestry of our lives.

With all my heart,

Yours,

Vidhu
